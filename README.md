#**NBA Stats Chatbot**

This is a chatbot I decided to make for fun that give users the ability to check for live game scores and player stats in the nba.
The bot gets player stats and live scores from `data.nba.net` and returns it back to the user.
Messages were tokenized word by word and analyzed through a scoring system to find the most likely request.
